# Viviwolf
An Overwolf skin inspired by Vivaldi.

**Note:** This skin may not still work. I can no longer test it as Overwolf doesn't support Linux and does not run in Wine. If that changes in the future, or if I ever buy a Windows PC, I will pick this project back up.

### Installation instructions:

1. Navigate to:Â C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\Overwolf (open start menu, type %localappdata%, hit enter, open Overwolf folder)
2. Create new folder. Name it "Skins."
3. Open the zip package you downloaded.
4. Drag the folder inside the zip into the Skins folder.
5. Open your Overwolf settings dialogue.
6. Open the Support menu.
7. Click "Development Options."
8. Click "Load unpacked extension..."
9. Navigate to the skin you want to install, expand the folder.
10. Select the version number.
11. Press "OK."
12. Load the skin from your Overwolf library.
